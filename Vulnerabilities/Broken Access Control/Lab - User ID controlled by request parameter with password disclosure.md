# Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure

- We can simply escalate to `administrator` by tampering the user ID parameter.
- Then, we can retrieve administrator password from the source code.
- Administrator password -> `j5jiy2hvq716er1vd029`.
- Log in as `administrator` and delete the `carlos` user.
